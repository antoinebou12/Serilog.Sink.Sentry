## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please take the following steps:

1. Do not create a public issue on GitHub.
2. Instead, send an email detailing the vulnerability to our security team at antoine.boucher012@gmail.com. Please provide as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and scope of the potential issue.
3. Expect an initial reply within 48 hours confirming that we have received your email, and we'll follow up with an assessment and plan for resolution within 96 hours.
4. Please do not disclose the vulnerability to others until we've had a chance to address it.
5. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and release it as part of our next patch version. We will also give you credit for the discovery in the release notes, unless you wish to remain anonymous.
6. If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide an explanation as to why.

Your contribution to improving the security of our project is greatly appreciated.
